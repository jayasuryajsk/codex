# Codex Frontend

A minimal Tauri-based UI for Codex that embeds the `codex-core` crate for business logic.

## Development

Install the Tauri CLI:

```sh
cargo install tauri-cli
```

Start the development server:

```sh
cargo tauri dev
```

This will launch a desktop window with a prompt input, file search, and patch apply controls.
